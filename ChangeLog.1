1.3.28  2001-11-30

   C API to gamalib C++ classes and functions (see gamalib/c/api/capi_demo.c)
   ******************************************

   - Functions for printing formatted output were moved from
                gamaprog/linux/gama/review 
     to new location
                gamalib/local/results/text.  

     It is planned for future versions to produce adjustment results
     in XML (functions in directory local/results/xml) and current
     text functions shell be rewritten to process the XML data as
     their input


1.3.27  2001-11-28

   - bug in GKFparser / zero reference standard deviation m0 etc. in
     XML input (Jan Pytel)

   - program `slovnikar' changed to generate all undefined texts set to
     "internal error : program must call function set_gama_language()"


1.3.26  2001-11-24

   - slope distances with corresponding zenith angles are used to fake
     horizontal distances when computing approximate coordinates xy
     (internaly in class Acord)

   - GKFparser class member functions

        double implicit_stdev_distance(double d) const;
        double implicit_stdev_direction() const;
        double implicit_stdev_angle() const;

     declared to be public (were private)


1.3.25  2001-11-22

   - bug in `approximate coordinates' (when creating a local
     approximate coordinates object all observations were copied and
     not only horizontal observations, ie not only horizontal
     distances, directions and angles)

        diff -r1.2 g2d_coordinates.h
        137c137
        <           OD.for_each(Observation::CopyTo(SM));
        ---
        >           OD.for_each(Observation::CopyHorizontalTo(SM));


1.3.24  2001-11-17

   - added directory gamalib/c/api for C API interface functions to
     gamalib and basic functions for handling GaMaLib C++ exceptions
     from C.

     Include <gamalib/c_api.h> for C API interface to GaMaLib

   - program gama doesn't cut off input characters before tag
     <?xml...?> and after </gama-xml> tag (from this version, this must
     be done outside `gama')

   - into function GKFparser::error(const char* text) added test

        diff -r1.20 gkfparser.h
        169a170,172
        >           // store only the first detected error
        >           if(errCode) return 1;

     When debugging C API to GaMaLib, C program `capi_demo' reported
     different error messages then `gama'. The reason was that `gama'
     reads XML input by lines and C `capi_demo' reads input into a
     buffer (1024 chars).  Expat detected the error, but continued
     processing the whole buffer and thus `capi_demo' reported the
     last error detected by `expat'.


1.3.23  2001-11-03

   - remaining Czech comments translated to English

   - subdirectory gamalib/local/nacrt was removed. "nacrt" (sketch)
     contained classes for producing network sketch in xfig format and
     it was used in gama only as a conditional compile. I decided to
     removed it now because translating comments would not be enough,
     it needs all class and function names to be translated to English
     and the more, it needs update to reflect different orientation of
     coordinate axes. I would like to put it back when it is all in
     English but I want to discuss it with its author first (Jan Pytel
     is now bussy with Qt based GUI and "sketch" can wait)

   - added warning message (appended to network description) if
     obsoleted GaMa XML attributes are used (see GKFparser.cpp)

   - renamed Format class members (output precisions in fixed format):

         diff -r1.2 format.h         # cvs diff ... edited/shorten
         33,35c33,35
         <   static int souradnice_p;
         <   static int grady_p;

         >   static int coordinates_p;

         39c39

         ---
         >   static int coord_p(int n = coordinates_p)

         ---
         >   static int stdev_p(int n = standard_deviations_p)


1.3.22  2001-11-02

   - Former (sub)library Median is now considered to be integral part of
     GaMaLib,

         extern const char* GaMaLib_Median_version; 

     is no longer used.  Here comes the English translation of Median
     changelog (zmeny.cpp):

1.3.21   2001-10-29

   - gmatvec version 0.9.14

   - in ChangeLog (this file) all remaining Czech texts were
     translated to English.  Next step is going to be thorough revision
     of GaMa sources -- all Czech comments will be translated.

   - a minor change (typo) in review "test of linearization ..."

   - in constructor PointID::PointID(const char*) allowed zero
     pointers (Jan Pytel). The question is if it wouldn't be better to
     throw an exception?


1.3.20   2001-09-05

   - one more change in gamalib/xml/encoding.cpp to avoid warning
     message:

         >       init_tab = false;
         >     }


1.3.19   2001-09-05

   - a lot of changes by Jan Pytel needed to compile with new version
     of g++ (gcc version 2.96 20000731 / Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-81);
     see cvs-diff-1.3.18-1.3.19.txt

   - and some other minor changes needed to compile with Microsoft
     compiler; no problems with Borland compiler as usual (see
     make-bc-1.3.19.txt and make-msc-1.3.19.txt)


1.3.18   2001-08-25

   - for `inconsistent' coordinate systems sing of y coordinates are
     changed and the sign is reversed on output

   - added classes LocalCoordinateSystem and AngularObservations


1.3.16   2001-08-05

   - enhanced version of computation of approximate heights by Jan Pytel

   - removed bug in the counts of computed coordinates (see class Acord)


1.3.15   2001-07-27

   - term "empirical" replaced by "aposteriori" in output texts

1.3.14   2001-07-25

   - added command line parameter --version

   - function PointID::to_string() introduced in 1.3.13 renamed to
     PointID::str() .... inspired by std::stringstream.str() etc.

   - class data member LocalNetwork::SB renamed to `PD' (point data)
     as well as other public member functions with Czech names


1.3.13   2001-07-23

   - a bug in template <class Iterator> void TrimWhiteSpaces(Iterator& b,
     Iterator& e) corrected by Jan Pytel:

   - new sorting scheme for PointIDs by Jan Pytel: positive integers
     first and then strings (see pointid.h)


1.3.12   2001-07-22

   - minor changes needed to compile with bc


1.3.11   2001-07-20

   - modified version of gmatvec/svd.h is used in this version trying
     to avoid problems with convergence in SVD::diagonalization(); 
     it is not solution of the problem but just a dirty hack:

1.3.10   2001-07-18

   - test on zero number of unknowns in LocalNetwork::vyrovnani_()


1.3.09   2001-07-15

   - in gama.cpp added test for networks without unknowns (all points
     fixed and no orientations)

   - replace approximate z coordinate by adjusted one in refinement of
     unknown parameters in iterated adjustment


1.3.08   2001-07-14

   - adjusted bearings greater than 400g reduced to interval <0, 400)

   - program gen-test for generating random crash test input data
     (see gamaprog/linux/gama/examples/gen-test):

     a) points with "singular coordinates xy" are removed before
        adjustment (if all points, but one, are set fixed and the
        resulting normal equations are singular)

     b) check for observation sets with directions pointing to the same
        target station

     c) indeterminable points are detected and removed (coordinates
        with standard deviation greater then 10 meters)


1.3.07   2001-07-11

   - new xml output in <<operator(ostrem&, PointData&) in pobs/write.cpp

   - corrected error on linearization of zenith angle (mistaken name s for d)

         <    Double k  = 10*R2G/(s*sd*sd);
         ---
         >    Double k  = 10*R2G/(d*sd*sd);

         ---
         >    Double pz = -k *  d *  d;

   - linearization of slope distances

         <    bearing_sdistance(PD[obs->from()], PD[obs->to()], s, sd);
         ---

         >    Double px = dx / sd;
         >    Double py = dy / sd;
         >    Double pz = dz / sd;

   - removed obscure functions bearing_sdistance (pobs/bearing.h)

   - corrected error in Point::set_constrained_z()

   - changed order of points in the review of adjusted unknowns --- points
     are sorted by their IDs in this version

   - added test into class GKFparser for variance-covariance matrix
     to be positive definite

   - added test into class Observation for identical standpoint and target
     points (and similarly into class Angle for second/right target)


1.3.06   2001-07-09

   - new class Acord for computation of approximate coordinates (xy,
     xyz and z); current version is just a wrapper for "median" with
     simple computation of unknown heights (cogo removed in this
     version).

   - new review of approximate coordinates

   - added new function Point::active() and renamed the following
     functions in Point class:

        s/  set_fixed_point/         set_fixed_xy/
        s/  set_free_point/          set_free_xy/
        s/  set_constrained_point/   set_constrained_xy/
        s/  set_fixed_height/        set_fixed_z/
        s/  set_free_height/         set_free_z/

1.3.05   2001-06-30

   - optional parameter --algorith svd | gso (classes LocalNetwork
     and OLS rewritten as base virtual classes to enable algoritmh
     switching)


1.3.04   2001.06.26

   - tag <dh/> allowed inside <obs> section (apart from <height-differences>)

   - introduced constrained heights and new XML syntax for definition of
     point type in adjustment  <point fix="..." adj="..." />


1.3.03   2001.06.18

   - minor corrections in translation of adjustment output (review.lang)


1.3.02   2001.06.16

   - first version of English translation of adjustment results


1.3.01   2001.06.14

   - implicit language is set to English

   - nonstandard code "cz" can be used for Czech apart from standard "cs"

   - dir. gamaprog/gama/linux/prehled renamed to gamaprog/gama/linux/review;
     file zakladni_parametry renamed to general_parameters etc.

   There is no stable version following version 1.1; version 1.3.00 is
   practically identical to 1.1.66. The first goal of version 1.3 is
   to translate Czech adjustment output into English.


1.1.66   2001.05.08

   - new function set_language (we don't use GNU gettext, but changing for
     gettext should be easy if needed)

   - optional parameter "--language en|cz" in the program gama (only
     error messages in this version)


1.1.65   2001.05.05

   - bad XML tag in pobs/local/write.cpp (was <obs at="..."  must be
     <obs from="...")
   - bug in the output of linearization test (iterated adjustment)
 

1.1.64   2001.05.03

    - first version of adjustment of observed vectors 

      Note: test of abs. terms is skipped for Coordinates and Vectors


1.1.63   2001.04.27

    - the following names were renamed:

            Point.test_yxz       -->       test_xyz
                  test_yx                  test_xy

      etc. [Krovak coordinates are usually presented as (y,x) and not
      (x,y) but Krovak is a local Czech coordinate system and
      traditional order of its coordinates is unusual]   and

            smernik              -->       bearing
            delka                          distance

    - added structures XYZ, XY and Z for safer Point constructors (see
      rgrep -I "Point::" gamalib)

    - added new tags into gama-xml.dtd : s-distance, z-angle,
      height-differences, dh, vectors, vec

    - "single distances" and "single angles" removed from XML input,
      ie. distances and angles outside the tag <obs> (GKFparser)

    - class GKFparser rewritten to reflect latest chnges in DTD
      suggested by Jan Kolar (Kolda)

    - no identical file names (in different directories) in Makefiles;
      see gamalic/local/observation_local.cpp

    - [gamaprog/linux/gama/prehled/opravy_pozorovani.h] estimation of
      "real errors of observed and adjusted values are calculated only
      for uncorrelated observations


1.1.62   2001.04.24

    - added attribute version into tag gama-xml (gama-xml.dtd).
      Attribute version can be omitted in this version, the only
      acceptable value is "2.0" (question: should attribute `value' be
      redefined in DTD as #REQUIRED ?)

    - added CVS keyword "Id:" into all source files (*.h, *.cpp)

    Note: Petr Doubrava reported problems with MSC makefiles; the
          source of problems are compiler switches (not clear why)


1.1.61   2001.04.21

    - namespace GaMaLib_Median renamed to namespace Median (first of all
      because of problems with MSC but we do not need it anyway)

    - added Makefiles for Microsoft Visual C++ (first draft tested
      under NT with Developers Studio 6.0 -- only static library at
      this version; as I know almost nothing about windows platform,
      my makefiles are undoubtedly clumsy) AC

    - corrected two bugs in gama-xml.dtd (v. 2.03 -- thanks to Jan Pytel 
      and Jan Kolar)


1.1.60   2001.04.16 

    - gamalib/revision.[h|cpp] moved to gamalib/local (Jan Pytel), 
      similarly moved gamadata.[h|cpp], point.h and directories
      gamalib/pobs and gamalib/median; in directory gamalib/ now
      should be remaining no files dependent on local coordinates (?)

    - added file scripts/for-all-gkf.bat for bulk computations under
      windows

    - removed file scripts/MrProper (now done by Makefile)


1.1.59   2001.04.14

    - corrected Makefile for bcc32, revision.h a linearization.h 
      according to suggestions by Petr Soucek

    - minor change in main Makefile (to implicitly compile all project
      or print help on the first use)


1.1.58   2001.04.08

    - coefficients of project equations for slope distancec and 
      zenith angles and function smernik_sdelka (Jan Pytel)

    - changes in usage of sparse matrix of project equations Asp

      Comment: output of project equations matrix is correct only
               for uncorrelated observations ... new general format
               is needed!


1.1.57   2001.04.01

    Finished transition to new calculation of project equations and
    revision of observations (from class Observation removed all methods
    with relations to coordinate system)

    - class NetInfo renamed to LocalNetwork (gamalib/local/network.*)

    - added new directory gamalib/observation/write (similarly
      gamalib/local)


1.1.56   2001.03.31

    Preparation for transition to new computation of project
    equations.  Until now old virtual functions revision() and
    linearization() are still called but now through independent classes
    Revision and Linearization, which are independent on classes derived
    from base class Observation. AC

    - added template class SparseGeneralMatrix (directory gamalib/sparse)
      for computation of project equation coefficients

    - in InfoNet (temporarily?) removed working vector of weights `w'

    - new class LocalNetwork (in directory gamalib/local), in future
      shall replace class InfoNet; all references to InfoNet rewritten
      to LocalNetWork.

    - new abstract classes Revision and Linearization

    - new classes LocalRevision and LocalLinearization (meanwhile
      only formally; they rely on existing "revision" and
      calculation of coeffificients from classes derived from Observation).

    - renamed classes (and corresponding files)

                 SlopeDistance    to    S_Distance
                 ZenithAngle      to    Z_Angle
                 HeightDiff       to    H_Diff

1.1.54   2001.03.21

    - removed forgotten `#include <vector>' in point.h (Jan Pytel)

    - added observation types SlopeDistance and ZenithAngle (Jan Pytel);
      meanwhile only as formal non-functioning model!

         Comment: SlopeDistance derived directly from class
                  Observation and not from class Distance; this might
                  be discussed, but suppose this to be the best way (AC)

    - processing of types SlopeDistance and ZenithAngle added to class
      GKFparser but meanwhile not into outpue gama/prehled (AC)


1.1.53   2001.03.18

    - corrected two "bugs" reported by borland compiler (in fact
      I am not quite sure if they are realy bugs)


1.1.52   2001.03.17

    - rewritten computation of approximate heights void
      ApproximateHeights::execute()


1.1.51   2001.03.16

    - debuging adjustment of leveling network (first working version)

    - new names (renamed just those functions that I have changed):

          NetInfo::redakce_bodu()    ==>  NetInfo::revision_points()
          NetInfo::redakce_mereni()       NetInfo::revision_observations()
          NetInfo::nedef_yx()             NetInfo::undefined_coordinates()
          NetInfo::rovnice_oprav(.*)      NetInfo::project_equations(.*)
          NetInfo::test_absl_clen(.*)     NetInfo::test_abs_term(.*)

    - removed bug in test of linearizations (I considered just first N
      observations, where N was the number of unknowns); output was
      changed to show only those observations that exceeds tollerance.


1.1.50   2001.03.14

    - first version of observation type "height difference" and
      "coordinate differences" (ie. components of observed vectors -
      not tested yet!)

    - added files INSTALL a README, minor changes in
     script/upgrade-GaMa, script/build-gamalib-Makefile and others
     (mainly filtering out of backup files using: grep -v \# | grep -v
     \~ )


1.1.49   2001.03.02

    - added files ChangeLog a TODO

    - removed bug in SVD (gmatvec-0.9.11)

    - added function BaseOLS::cond() { return 0; } for
      computation/estimate of condition number


1.1.48   2001.03.01

    - added file AUTHORS (first version is not very detailed), in Makefile
      added compile gamalib with algorithm GSO


1.1.47   2001.02.26

    - finished transition to GNU Lesser GPL


1.1.46   2001.02.25

   - added text GNU Lesser GPL (re-edited text licence to LGPL in
     gamaprog and gmatvec)

   - added directory gamaprog/linux/gama/examples and enhanced Makefile
     with computation of example input data


1.1.45   2001.02.23

   - formal changes in naming of project GaMa/GaMaLib

   - tar archive gamalib-a.b.c.tgz cintains all files in directory
     gamalib-a.b.c, ie. in directory gamalib-"version number"


1.1.44   2001.02.22

   - in class Observation renamed method at() to from(); (in xml input
     files meanwhile left at="..." as a synonym for from="...")

   - preparation for introduction of new types "height differences"
     and "vectors""


1.1.43   2001.02.21

   - reorganization of files pobs/\*.cpp (content of files
     linearization.cpp, revision.cpp and write.cpp moved to new files
     direction.cpp, distance.cpp, angle.cpp and xyz.cpp; files
     revision.cpp a linearization.cpp removed)

   - minor chages in scripts (mainly scripts/upgrade-GaMa)


1.1.42   2001.02.12

   - bug in print of "type of unknown"


1.1.41   2000.12.04

   - preparation for CVS (scripts/GaMaLib_archiv and scripts/gMatVec)

   - renamed member functions of class Point:

        s/vloz_yx/set_yx/g
        s/vloz_z/set_z/g
        s/zrus_yx/unset_yx/g
        s/zrus_z/unset_z/g
        s/nastav_pevny_bod/set_fixed_point/g
        s/nastav_urcovany_bod/set_free_point/g
        s/nastav_operny_bod/set_constrained_point/g
        s/nastav_dana_vyska/set_fixed_height/g
        s/nastav_urcovana_vyska/set_free_height/g

        s/urcovana_vyska/free_height/g
        s/vyskovy_bod/height_point/g

     Comment: I had been waiting with the renaming of these functions
              until final version of English tag names in input XML is
              settled. It's not clear if there will be some more
              changes in XML or not but there is no reason to wait any
              more. Let's just hope that possible future changes won't
              be principal.


1.1.40   2000.12.03

   - corrected files Makefile-slovnikar, Makefile-utf8-ascii and
     Build_GaMa


1.1.39   2000.11.11

   - added directory gamaprog/linux and added scripts for generating
     filese for borland make in directory gamaprog/borland from linux'
     makefiles

   - directives #include "prehled/..." changed to #include <prehled/...>
     

1.1.38   2000.10.09

   - removed bug in function << (std::ostream& str, PointData& sez);
     output of point (was wrongly at="..." instead of correct id="...")


1.1.37   2000.10.08

   - added a tiny program scripts/utf8-ascii.cpp as an alternative to
     recode, which is not available in slink


1.1.36   2000.10.06

   - script build-doc-html changed to work both in potato and slink
   - basic data structure scheme added to html documentations of classes
     for handling observables


1.1.35   2000.09.21

   - in XML allowed white spaces before and after numerical value of
     attributes, (see intfloat.h) - corrected (unused) template function
     Read_Sparse_Abw


1.1.34   2000.09.11

   - change in print of adjusted observations (in the case of
     "observed coordinates" I have to enable columns wider than 12
     characters)

   - corrected error in xml output of adjusted coordinates

   - into collection ef examples added test data for sequantial
     adjustment, or in other words test on input type "observed
     coordinates" (after manusripta Mervart-Cimbalnik: "Vyssi geodezie 2).
     Comment: pay attention to aposteriory variances


1.1.33   2000.08.29

   - changed the order of indexing unknowns XYZ in project equations
     (used to be YX); orientation shifts are marked as 'R' (used to be
     'Z'); in the order XY are now printed adjusted coordinates to ouptut.

   - removed "test on suspiciously big corrections" in function for
     testing linearization errors.


1.1.32   2000.08.27

   - corrected mistakes in collection of examples in descriptions
     (sed!), minor improvement of script build-doc-html, removed bug
     in script build-gamalib-Makefile, removed bug in gamalib_dep
     (must the path to gamalib for files withous explicit path
     specification)

   - in virtual functions write (Observation) replaces Chzech tags
     by their English equivalents

   - preparation for adjustment of correlated observations


1.1.31   2000.08.23

   - in scprits/Build_GaMa corrected generating of Makefile for
     gama.cpp (unified with makefiles for gamalib and expat)

   - gama-xml.dtd 2.00; all test converted to new format (changed
     attribute `typ' to 'xy')


1.1.30   2000.08.21

   - for computing of approximate values of coordinates we copy to
     local working observation list only horizontal directions, angles
     anf distances (see template class Observation::CopyHorizontalTo
     used in template std::for_each)

   - lesser changes in structure of directories, scripts etc.:
     directory spript renamed to scripts; added new Makefile for
     compile of expat; gamalib2html and slovnikar moved to directory
     scripts.

   - added scripts/gamalib_dep.cpp for computing dependences for
     generating makefiles (I haven't found, how easily removed 
     references to system libraries as generated by g++; I would
     like to generate makefile for bcc compiler in future)

   - corrected two typos in gkfparser.lang and gama.lang (JV)


1.1.29   2000.08.17

   - new version gmatvec 0.9.8 (transiton to g++ 2.95.2 / Debian potato)

   - into template function XML_adjusted_coordinates added third parameter
     bool, to control if covariance matrix of adjusted coordinates should
     be writen to output or not.

   - in script/build-dictionaries replace command for removal of accents

       2UTF -r iso8859-2 < language.cz | cstocs il2 ascii > language.cpp
     
     by program recode

       recode UTF-8..iso8859-2 < language.cz | cstocs il2 ascii > language.cpp
     
     Comment: program 2UTF is not available in Debian potato; the same
              will have to be rewritten in email version of gama (I am
              removing accents for easier comparision with older
              versions of results)


1.1.28   2000.08.15

   - in gama-xml.dtd introduced new observation type "observed coordinates"l
     see XML tag <coordinates>

        Comments: meanwhile just a proposal, implementation later !!!

   - added template function XML_adjusted_coordinates(),
     to be used to output adjusted coordinates:

          <coordinates>
             <point ... />
             ...
             <cov-mat> ... </cov-mat> 
          </coordinates>

     ie. one tag and to a whole xml document. Later should be added another
     functions presenting adjustment results in xml.


1.1.27   2000.08.14

   - another changes in structure of directories:

      * directory bodmer renamed to gamalib/pobs, several files
        moved and put together
      * directory infosit renamed to gamalib/netinfo and class InfoSit
        renamed to NetInfo
      * in class observation renamed function redakce_mereni to
        revision 
      * removed bm_* exceptions (formerly bodmer/vyjimka.h)

   - minor change in output header


1.1.26   2000.08.12

   - point attribute type="adjusted" changed to type="free"


1.1.25   2000.08.11

   - removed bug computation of coefficients of homogenized project 
     equations for the case of non-diagonal covariance (sub)matrix;
     added two test examples into collection of sample input data.

   - changed test on number of elements of covariance matrix and
     corrected error in function Cluster::activeCov() const (test
     non-diagonal covariances)


1.1.24   2000.08.07

   - characters \n and \t transfered from gama.lang into gama.cpp (+
     two minor changes in program slovnikar 0.02)

   - all error messages from GKFparser transfered into gkfparser.lang

   - added input of covariance matrix in GKFparser


1.1.23   2000.08.04

   - first experiment with use of program `slovnikar' (lexicographer
    in English) for transition to multilingual version of gamalib /
    gama. I have introduced following convenstions and I hope their
    usage will represent a trouble:

     a) input XML bathes for building dictionary have extension .lang

     b) all identifiers start with T_ (we shall introduce identifiers
        in English; see gamaprog/gama/gama.lang as an example)

     c) I suggest to derive names of`lang' files from an "essential"
        header file
        (for example gkfparser.h => gkfparser.lang);
        but this need not be a strict rule.

     Let's hope that other rules will be clarified later from
     practical experience ;-)

     Comment: in XML prolog must must declaration encoding="..." 
     ******** PRECEDE declaration standalone="yes" !!!


1.1.22   2000.08.03

   - renamed the following functions (sed):

               s/from/at/g
               s/target2/rs/g    # `right sight station' 
               s/target/to/g

   - and similarly in gama-xml.dtd 


1.1.21   2000.08.02

   - in GKFparser introduced English tags (Czech tags still left
     there); added new version of parameters for computation of
     implicit values of stadnard deviations for distances:
     distance-stdev="10 4 1" (old version left for backward
     compatibility)


1.1.20   2000.07.30

   - for adjustment of correlated observations
     =========================================

     Prior to adjustment project equations are transforemed to
     "homogenized form" (see Charamza: Geodet/PC, Zdiby 1990); this
     off course means that the meaning of weight coefficient of
     adjusted observations has changed and q_bb must be properly
     transformed.

     Warning: adjusted corrections of unknowns and adjusted residuals
              should be already correct even for correlated observations;
              but formulas for some other characteristics are correct only 
              for uncorelated input.

   - added functions Cluster::activeCov(), that return covariance
     matrix of active observations



1.1.19   2000.07.27

   - Cluster::bind() renamed to Cluster::update()


1.1.18   2000.07.27

   - in class Point renamed unknown "height" from "v" to "z"

   - classes CopyTo and CopyActiveTo rewritten as internal classes of
     Observation, name of function member "observations" in clss
     OdservationData changed to "for_each" (according similar standard
     template). Copying of all observations is thus written this way:
    
            my_obs_data.for_each(Obseravation::CopyTo(obs_list));

   - in class Observation removed functions vloz_mer and vloz_str,
     which were never used and renamed remaining methods into English

   - removed bug in GKFparser (program failed to process examples
    tch*.gkf, that define no orientations).In class GKFparser
    "temporarily" alowed usage of distances and angles outside tag
    <osnova>.  This way it is defined in the current version - but I
    plan to forbid this in next version in gkf files and leave it
    there as undocumented feature for backward compatibility.  Will be
    removed in future!


1.1.17   2000.07.25

   - in class ObservationalData removed common vector of observations;
     each cluster has its own vector of observables.


1.1.16   2000.07.24

   - reorganization of header files of functions and classes for data
     structures handling (observation.h, cluster.h, gamadata.h)

   - in constructors Direction, Angle a Distance removed parameters
     for setting pointers to cluster and cluster_index -- maintained
     by Cluster::bind()


1.1.15   2000.07.23

   - removed bug in Orientation (during mass computations was skipped
     first observation in orientation set)

   - change in template function for print of review of approximate
     coordinates (copying of lists replaced by const references)

     For sample network mt-1189-77.gkf was printed negative number of
     points with known coordinates (not for other samples!); solved
     this as follows, the number is calculated by constructor (AC)

        Comment: it seems that this version gives, at last, the same
        ******** results as 1.0.01 (not counting "noise"; it's not
                 clear to me, why the computation of approximate
                 coordinates differs - from practical point of view it
                 is not relevant)


1.1.14   2000.07.22

   - introduction of covariance matrices: in class Observation removed
     attribute "standard deviation" (stdDev_/str_), same in Distance,
     Direction and Angle; in constructors of these classes similarly
     removed parameter "standard deviation" (must be defined
     covariance matrix in corresponding cluster).

   - a change in constructor of class GKFparser
 
   - new versions of scripts Make_GaMa, Build_GaMa and
     build-gamalib-Makefile (from Makefilu, created for linux by
     build-gamalib-Makefile, might be possible to automaticaly
     generate makefile for Borland compiler; I tried to filter out
     unwanted header files in the script, but I had given it up)


1.1.13   2000.07.21

   - introduced class ObservationData, that joins ObservationList and
     ClusterList and defines common global functions (copying etc.)
     On this ocasion in sake of symetry I have renamed PointList to
     PointData.

     Definition of class PointData moved (from gamalist.h) to a common
     header file gamalib/gamadata.h for both essential data structure
     classes PointData and ObservationData.

     In gamalibu replaced all include file direktives as gamalist.h
     and similar by reference to one common header file
     gamalib/gamadata.h

     In class PriblSour changed constructor parameter ObservationList
     to ObservationData (sources reformated by emacs function indent);
     similar changes in InfoSit

   - corrected "normalization of bearing" in class Orientation


1.1.12   2000.07.21

   - basic methods of class Observation translated into English:
   from(), target(), target2(), value(), stdDev()

   - in class Cluster added public mutable attribute "tag", in class
     Observation method for its accessing "tag()"; and more in class
     Observation added non-constant method ptr_cluster()

        !!! crashes on mt-1189-77.gkf a mt-131-84.gkf !!!


1.1.11   2000.07.20

   - corrected minor error in class  Orientation (output parameter)


1.1.10   2000.07.19

   - removed bug in InfoSit::rovnice_oprav(); apart from test on
     undefined orientation shift we have to reject orientation sets
     with signle direction.

     Note: it seems that there is a problem with computation of
           orientation shifts during computation of approximate
           coordinates. It seems that sometimes are store orientation
           shifts computed in local/working coordinate system.  At
           this point I simply solved the problem by clearing all
           orientation shifts and then recomputing them again (see
           gama.cpp).


1.1.09   2000.07.17

   - orientation shifts moved from class Point to class StandPoint

   - from directions removed attribute "number of orientation set"
     (and on this occation corrected error in std::ostream& operator
     << (std::ostream& str, ObservationList& sez); operator wrongly
     joined two sets on a single point (see example
     dve-osnovy-uhel.gkf)

   - class for computing of orientation shifts renamed to  Orientation
     (was VypOrPos); see <gamalib/orientation.h>


     !!! WARNING: solution crashes for data sets kablo-2000-3.gkf,
     !!!          karmelit.gkf and mt-131-94.gkf


1.1.08   2000.07.16

   - added reference to class ClusterList into classes GKFparser and
     InfoSit; at this moment does nothing

   - introduce class StandPoint (: public Cluster) for uncorrelated
     directions, distances and angles


1.1.07   2000.07.13

   - removed file gamalib/bodmer/cisbod.h (replaced by
     gamalib/pointid.h)

   - renamed file gamalist/bodmer/seznam.h to gamalist/gamalist.h.
     File gamalist/bodmer/seznam.cpp removed. Functions

          void pridej_seznam_bodu  (SezBod& cil, const SezBod& zdroj);
          void pridej_seznam_mereni(SezMer& cil, const SezMer& zdroj);

     were newer used (I found it accidentaly on a check of Makefilu
     for bcc). I left declarations of all three in one header file 
     partly because of "historical reasons" and then because
     they are there  "neetly together". May be that later we will
     movee them towards declarations of corresponding classes (?).

   - renamed classes: SezCB  --> PointIDList
                      SezBod --> PointList
                      SezMer --> ObservationList


1.1.06   2000.07.12

   - renamed classes: Mereni --> Observation
                      Delka  --> Distance
                      Smer   --> Direction
                      Uhel   --> Angle 

         Note: At this moment just formally renamed without andy
               functional changes

   - renamed file gamalib/bodmer/mereni.h --> gamalib/observation.h


1.1.05   2000.07.12

   - header file gamalib/point.h replaced gamalib/bodmer/bod.h (file
     bod.h deleted); Class Bod renamed to Point. In all files deleted
     namespace GaMaLib_BodMer (replaced by GaMaLib).  More, in
     subdirectory bodmer removed header file float.h (moved directly
     to directory gamalib) ... and as we are moving to English, I have
     renamed subdirectory skript to script ;-)


1.1.04   2000.07.11

   - introduced directory doc
   - defined class PointID that replaces class CisBod


1.1.03   2000.07.10

   - corrected Makefile for bcc


1.1.02   2000.05.17

   - adopted improved version of xml encoding by Petr Doubrava from
     stable version 1.0.01 a improved projects VC++ gama/gamalib


1.1.01   2000.05.14

  - update of gkfparser and added recoding windows-1250 and latin-2 by
    Petr Doubrava (adopted from version 0.9.59)


1.1.00   2000.05.03

==========================================================================

0.9.58   2000.05.01

  - corrected errors in xml/gkfparser.cpp found by Jan Pytel  

  - changes in projects VC++ after suggestions by Petr Doubrava


0.9.57   2000.04.26

  - added try/catch blok in all methods in library Median. Exceprions
    Median::ps_chyba are send by throw for next processing, for all
    ather exceptions is returned state pocet_reseni = -1 (in English:
    number_of_solutions = -1). This update was motivated by situation,
    when in library Median is demanded computation of bearing for two
    identical points.

          For details see median/g_fce.cpp a median/g_ulohy.cpp.


0.9.56   2000.04.15

  - in gama-xml.dtd changed types of numerical attributes from CDATA to
    NMTOKEN after sugestion by Miloslav Nic

  - in templates IsInteger and IsFloat removed calling of function
    SkipWhiteSpaces; because NMTOKEN doesn't allow white spaces in
    attributes, I consider white spaces in a numerical attribute to be
    error (ass well as introductory and triling white spaces and empty
    string - see XML REC [7] on page 4)


0.9.55   2000.04.13

  - added simple test of input format of type double in function
    GKFparser::toDouble(); see also gamalib/intfloat.h


0.9.54   2000.04.04

  - corrected bug in program gama (junk after end of gkf input data
    is filtered out)


0.9.53   2000.04.01

  - Reading of input data was rewritten to reading by characters (this
    is not a joke!).  For several days I was not able to start expat
    working with borland compiler. There two reasons. It took me some
    time to realize that compilation fails just because of too many
    warnings that had to be switched off (see  gama_bc/Makefile). 
    Second problem was more serious.  Compiler bcc32 v. 5.5. wrongly
    implements functions stg::getline(std::istream&, std::vector&);
    into read in vector is added without warning binary zero ... expat
    naturaly such an document rejects as "not well formed". After this
    update GaMa works with all three compilers.


0.9.52   2000.03.31

  - renamed directory gamalib/gkf to gamalib/xml (I suppose that it
    will contain more then gkfparser.(h|cpp) one day.  Then renamed
    file xml/Makefile to xml/Makefile-gkfparser-demo (might be a model
    for other demo programs).

  - added (forgotten) test in gama to and tag </gama-xml> (gama
    ignores everything at the end of gkf files)

  - corrected skript/upgrade-GaMa


0.9.51   2000.03.30

  - library expat was extracted from gamalib. I thikn it's more
    correct on one hand and then, it's not necessary to distribute it
    on every update (may be that later will extracted eved sources
    from gamaprog - at this moment it's not necessary).

  - coorected organization of gamalib archive: added subdirectory 0.9
    (see skript/GaMaLib).

  - gamalib from this version relies on expat for XML data processing.
    From gamalib library removed class KonfiguracniSoubor and current
    templates for proecssing XML tags (infosit/znacka.h).

  - change of attributes `description' from class Infosit from
    std::list<std:string> to std::string (whole description is stored
    as a single string)

  - function bool PriblSour::Vypocet() ended in an infinite loop if
    either list fo observations or list of coordinates are empty.
    Added to the begining test

            if (SB.empty() || SM.empty()) return true;

    and added the same test into program gama.

  - during debuging of gama I have found a bug in conversion program
    geodet2gama (wrong output of introducing tag <body-mereni> - it
    was written as an empty tag) and several bugs I have introduces
    into testing gkf data myselve. In network description must not be
    characters as &, < or >.  According to XML specification we have
    to use &amp; &lt; &gt; ... etc.  
    ??? how is it handled by WebGaMa ???


0.9.50   2000.03.28

  - added directory gamaxml; new version 1.01 of file
    gamaxml/gama-xml.dtd.  In definition of element "osnova"
    (standpoint) added element "uhel" (angle). This was out approach
    until now, program gama accepted angles as elements of
    "standpoint"; it's a question that culd be discussed but I can not
    see any reason why to change current structure of existing data.
    In directory gamaxml should be even other dtd files in future.

  - example *.gkf separated from gamalib sources and added script
    skript/Priklady_GaMa (tgz is stored in directory archiv/gamalib;
    structure of example directories should be reconsidered)

  - changed output format in zapis_s.cpp and zapis_u.cpp after zapis_d.cpp
    ("<delka" "<smer " "<uhel " ... strings with of the same length)

  - removed error in printing of angles (!!!).  I wouldn' believe that
    such a silly bug could have been remaining in gamalib (unclosed
    attributes "observed value" and "standard deviation") ... we don't
    normaly work with angles and thus the bug remained hidden ;-(

  - in directory gamalib/gkf added a link to `priklady' (examples) and
    script `kontrola' (check); I will remove them later.  During first
    experiments I haven't met any problems and (probably) I will
    incorporate expat to gama in next version.

    Note: it's not clear to me, if I should ignore in class GKFparser
          everything before the tag <?xml version="1.0" ?> and after
          tag </gama-xml> as it was don until now; there are pros
          and cons as well.


0.9.49   2000.03.27

  - corrected text "uspesne vypocteno bodu .. " ("number of
    succesfylly computed points ...") in computing of approximate
    coordiantes (sugested by Jiri Vesely)

  - corrected scripts as sugested by Jan Pytel

  - in subdirectory gkf is updated version of class GKFparse (just a
    testing version now)


0.9.48   2000.03.25

  - in directory gamalib added subdirectories expat and gkf. In
    subdirectory gkf is plced a tiny program demo.cpp, that is a
    modified version of the example from expat and that I used to
    verify combination of C functions from expat and C++ classes and
    functions from gamalib. Until now I just experimented under
    Linux. From subdirectory expat I am going to remove everything
    taht is not necessary (*.dll, *.exe etc.) Current gamalib
    functions are not efected by this update.

  - script GaMaLib_ar renamed to Make_GaMaLib and libray gamalib.a was
    moved to gamaprog/lib (I hope that both is more logical and that
    this is the last change of this kind ;-)  It would be useful to
    add similar scripts for BCC and VC++ one day.


0.9.47   2000.03.24

  - new version gMatVec 0.9.7

  - added skript/GaMaLib_ar for generating (Linux) library and updated
    scripts Build_GaMa and Make_GaMa. Script GaMaLib_ar at this moment
    can not react to chages in header fules but only reflects changes
    in cpp files (must be improved!). Change makefile for conversion
    program `pogrom' to use gamalib-ar/gamalib.a


0.9.46   2000.03.15

  - values of normalized / studentized residuals for uncontrolled
    observations (f < 0.1) are not printed

  - added source code for conversion program gama/pogrom v. 0.01 (a
    conversion program for data exchange between `gama' and 'groma',
    a Czech local geodetic window program; not interesting for users
    outside CZ).


0.9.45   2000.02.17

  - private internal class KonfiguracniSoubor::xmlAttrib (from file
    infosit/konfsoubor.h) was turned into individual class xmlAttrib
    and stored into file infosit/znacka.h (I needed xml attributes for
    program GaMaD for editing of GaMa input data files, taht I need
    for presentation of C++ Builder 5 and until now I haven't made my
    mind which of general XML parsers I will use)


0.9.44   2000.02.09

  - program wouldn't print max. normalized residual (review of general
    parameters) if apriori standard referenvce variable was used
    during statistical analysis 


0.9.43   2000.02.07

  - new version gMatVec 0.9.5; matrix inversion was rewritten to use
    gauss-jordan algorithm, change of internal organization of header
    files.


0.9.42   2000.02.01

  - new version gMatVec 0.9.4; rewritten function inv(const Mat<>&)


0.9.41   2000.01.29

  - added global characteristics:

       a) maximal and average mean positional point error  (for 5 and
          more points)
       b) sorting of outlying observations 

  - updated scripts Build_GaMa and Make_GaMa so, that after a change 
    in files prehled.il2/.h automatically followed coding transformation
    and then make and it was not needed to call script Build_GaMa and
    compile the whole program again.


0.9.40   2000.01.22

  - new version gMatVec 0.9.3; number of allowed iteration in
    diagonalization of bidiagonal matrix during singular decomposition
    algorithm was raised from 30 to 300 (this should be "infinitu") -
    unfortunately 30 is sometimes not enough  ;-)


0.9.39   2000.01.19

  - library MatVec renamed to gMatVec

       On the Internet there is too much software called "matvec" (and
       the more, one is a matrix/vector C++ library); I hope that the
       name gMatVec is going to be be less conflicting.
 

0.9.38   2000.01.11

  - rejection of observations with huge absolute terms (we must repeat
    redaction of observations, redaction of project equations is not
    sufficient); see

               InfoSit::zrus_vybocujici_abs_cleny()).


0.9.37   2000.01.03

  - new version of library MatVec (in class of symmetric matrices was
    forgotten declaration of basic type `double' instead of Float)


0.9.36   2000.01.01

  - transition to new version of MatVec (0.9.0); in MatVec added new
    class MatVec::Exception, in implicit values of template arguments
    removed underlines in names of classes

  - updated script skript/MatVec (original of source text is now in
    directory gamalib/matvec; changes of version numbers is maintained
    by sed editor).

  - in gamalib/rand.cpp added directive for conditional translation
    for MS compiler


0.9.35   1999.12.29

  - tested under OS Windows with compilers VC++ 6.0 and Borland 5.4
    (C++ Builder4)

  - updated method Vyber_reseni::Vypocet(), see median/g_fce.cpp.  My
    opinion is that it was a bug, consider algorithm for choosing one
    of two solutions, as presented in Geolibu/PC on page 153 (this
    reference is of no use if you don't speak Czech ;-) In directory
    gamalib/median a file of difference produced by dif (to be removed
    in next versions).
 
  - infosit/konfsoubor.h: directive `using namespace std;' in
    constructor xmlAttrib (VC++ 6.0 doesn't know std::isspace)

  - corrected errror in template TestLinearizace

  - updated declarations in prehled.il2/elipsy_chyb.h according to
    VC++ 6.0 (VC++ 6.0 doesn't know std::sqrt)

  - updated file gama_bc/Makefile_bc, added files gama_bc/vypocet.bat,
    gama_vc/vypocet.bat and gama_vc/gama.cpp

  - g2g v.1.02 (corrected declarations according to warnings from
    bcc32 v.5.4)


0.9.34   1999.12.28

  - a change in void InfoSit::redakce_mereni(); program didn't handle
    situation, when all but one directions are removed from
    orientation set (target outside the given configuration of network
    points)

  - added script /gama/gama-priklady/vypocet for mass computation of
    test data (adds automatically number of version into output file
    name) and script /gama/gama-priklady/srovnej, for comparing
    results from different versions.


0.9.33   1999.12.27

  - change of implicit value of parameter 'sc' to 'false' in template
    InputTextStream (itstream.h); ie. we read implicitly even comment
    lines marked by character '#' (the change has impact only on
    infosit/konfsoubor.h)

  - error in helper program g2g (entity <osnova>; new version is 1.01)


0.9.32   1999.12.25

  - a change in output format of parameter g (error ellipsis)

  - added program gamaprog/gama/geodet2gama/g2g for conversion of
    coordinate batch in Geodet format (and stx) into format GaMa
    (xml); geodet is a local Czech program, interesting only to Czech
    speaking users.

       Note: because coordinate format of Geodet doesn't contain all
       information needed for network adjustment, it's necessary to
       revise the output xml file / input data for GaMa (fixed points,
       adjusted points etc.)  Program doesn't support conversion of
       angular values in sexadecimal format (um 360)


0.9.31   1999.12.23

  - a change in header of bad linearization


0.9.30   1999.12.21

  - in class Mereni (bodmer/mereni.h) added protected method
    norm_su(), that is called in constructors and virtual method
    vloz_mer() in classes Smer and Uhel (direction and angle) for
    "normalization" of angular value, ie. transformation into interval
    <0, 400).

       Prior this change program crashed during computation of
       approximate coordinates for sample data polygon-pd-cm.gkf (it
       differs from polygon-pd-mm.gkf only in that observed distances
       are rounded to centimeters).

       In this sample data is suspisious point with number 57210041,
       even after this change are approximate coordinates computed
       with error > 20m (bad network configuration; point cann't be
       practically computed!), but adjustment gives "acceptable"
       results (discrepancies in mm).

  - added method InfoSit::zpresneni_souradnic(), to replace
    approximate coordinates of unknown points with their adjusted
    values (not for constrained points) and aproximate values of
    orientation shifts by adjusted shifts

  - corrected (2x) error in methos OLSsvd::reset(...); there was
    missing SVD_::reset(A).  Error has no influence until now because
    in constructor was called "SVD_::reset()" and adjustment was not
    repeated.

       Note: in class OLSgso (alternative algorithm for solving
       project equations based on Gram-Schnidt ortogonalization) is
       everything OK because OLSgso uses protected attribute
       "is_solved" of base class BaseOLS.

  - added directives for conditional compilation in template functions
    prehled.il2 / *.h

  - added test on linearization error. Adjustment with update of
    approximate values of unknown coordinates repeats (3x max) if:

       a) maximal correction of unknown point (not constrained point)
          is greater or equal to 0.150 m (ie. 15 cm)

       b) maximal difference in a value of adjusted distance computed
          from residual and from adjusted coordinates is greater or
          equal to 0.0005 millimetre

       c) maximal transverse shift for direction or angle
          corresponding to adjusted value computed from adjsuted
          residual and from adjusted coordinates is greater or equal
          to 0.0005 millimetre
 

0.9.29   1999.11.23

  - in class Bod (point) added constructor with single parameter
    (point with a height) according to suggestion by Jan Pytel


0.9.28   1999.11.04

  - in class Bod (point) added attribute iv_ (index of a height in
    project equations) and methods for setting and testing of height
    points, rewritten methods for setting of types of positional
    points in adjustment (pevny/fixed, urcovany/adjusted,
    operny/constrained)


0.9.27   1999.09.28

  - in the review ov general parameters corrected wrong output of
    empirical reference standard deviation for the case, when we work
    with apriori reference standard deviation (actual value was
    printed)


0.9.26   1999.09.26

  - corrected bug in computation of implicit values of standard
    deviations for distances (we used distance and not the value of
    distance in kilometers)


0.9.25   1999.09.24

  - removed an obscure error in print of parameter g
    (prehled/elipsy_chyb.h); in condition ak>0 && bk>0 added test on
    "noise" (for the case wehn bk is practically zero). On this
    occasion I have added a test on mean positional error mp > 1e-3
    [mm] (for coordinates with practically zero standard deviation we
    do not compute coefficient).

  - corrected bad format in print of mean positional error of point mp

  - changed symbols [mm/cc] to [mm|cc] and [m/g] to [m|g]

  - renamed function InfoSit::vahko_opravy (used to be wrongly
    kovar_opravy); in English: weight coeffient of residua and
    covariance of residual

  - renamed functions cov_?? to q_?? (they are weight coefficients and
    not covariances): ls/baseols.h, ls/olssvd.h, ls/olsgso.h,
    infosit.h, infosit.cpp and matvec/matsvd.h (==> new version of
    matvec 0.8.0)

  - added scripts Build_GaMa and Make_GaMa, script gama_linux/build
    changed the way, that on generating  Makefile system header are removed


0.9.24   1999.09.19

  - format of results changed after suggestions by M. Hampacher:
     * standard deviations are not printed as +- xxx
     * units are not given for standard deviations

  - added script skript/Hledej_slovo (JP)

  - updated skript/GaMaLib (binary program gama is not stored in the archive)


0.9.23   1999.09.10

  - added Kolmogorov-Smirnov tes on normality of homogenized residuals
    (for the case of 30 observations and more)

  - in function InfoSit::stredni_elipsa_chyb and in olsgso.h added
    declaration using namespace std; and removed explicit declaration
    of namespace std in names std::sqrt a std::atan2 (MS compiler VC++
    doesn't has functions like sqrt and atan2 declared in namespace
    std).

    Note: for VC++ it is necessary to set up explicitly support for
          RTTI (see 0.9.15 1999.07.12)
   
  - the same in file olsgso.h

  - new verison of script skript/Porovnej_ver_gama enables to submit
    version nubmer and file name (JP)


0.9.22-a 1999.08.18

  - change in directories in GaMaLib project gama/archiv --> gama/skript
                                             gama/gama   --> gama/archiv

0.9.22   1999.07.30

  - in review of standard deviations and error ellipses added test for
    "nasty" networks (output format in "scientific notation"),
    confidence ellipse is not computed for points with positional
    error greater then one meter


0.9.21   1999.07.29

  - removed bug in main (forgotten underlina at class Nacrt)

0.9.20   1999.07.28

  - nacrt 0.0.3 (support for graphical sketch of the network)

0.9.19   1999.07.27

  - corrected bad condition for computation of confidence ellipses
    (condition was "reversed"); see prehled.il2/elipsy_chyb.h

0.9.18   1999.07.26

  - added network sketch by Pytel / verze 0.0.2 (viz gamalib/nacrt)

  - in class Bod (point) removed enumeration constant `pevny_smer'
    (fixed direction)

  - added function Infosit::stredni_elipsa_chyb()

  - added review of standard deviations and error ellipses  


0.9.17   1999.07.16

  - added estimation of "real errors" of observed/adjusted values (for
    the Czech speaking minority: see F. Charamza: Geodet/PC, VUGTK
    Zdiby 1990, page 183)


0.9.16   1999.07.14

  - first version of review of "residuals and analysis of
     observations" (meanwhile without estimates of real errors)

  - corrected function InfoSit::kontrola_mereni(int), see F. Charamza,
    Geodet/PC, Zdiby 1990, page 180 (the function hadn't been used)

  - in script build removed unused module skipcomm.cpp


0.9.15   1999.07.12

  - corrected text of exception "zero or negative distance / standard
    deviation" and other strings in bodmer/vyjimky.h

  - explicit catch for exception from constructors of classes Smer,
    Delka and Uhel (direction, distance and angle) in functions
    gkf_smer, gkf_delka and gkf_uhel in infosit/konfsoubor.h (catc all
    exceptions and call function KonfiguracniSoubor::chyba("...");
    ie. print line number and text where the error was detected during
    reading input data).
    
  - "minor" changes needed to compile with Visual C++/Borland C++

    Note: MS Visual C++ 6.0 doesn't implisitly set support for RTTI
    ==> Project Settings | C/C++ | C++ Language | Enable Run-Time Type
    Information (RTTI).


0.9.14   1999.07.09

  - in class Mereni (observation) deleted virtual function PtrSmer,
    PtrDelka a PtrUhel and replaced by casting dynamic_cast<>() (see
    verze 0.4.0 / egcs now fully supports RTTI)

  - added implicit standard deviations in xml input data (section
    <body-mereni>, see infosit/konfsoubor.h)


0.9.13   1999.07.06

  - corrected median/pribl_b.h (function bool
                                ZnameStan(SezMer::const_iterator i))
  
  For points is necessary to check existence of orientation shift with
  function test_z(int), it's not sufficient to test nubmer of shifts
  (see "logically" deleted orientation shifts with standard deviation -1).


0.9.12   1999.07.06

  - *** read input (configuration files) in  XML *** 

    !!! But for some configurations wouldn't compute approximate
    coordinates (for example dsuloha-c.gkf or dsuloha-d.gkf) - bearing
    for identical points !!!
   
  - deleted file bodmer/ctisebm.h 
  - files bodmer/znacka.* moved to infosit (and changed namespace)


0.9.11   1999.07.05

  - preparation for new format of input data (XML)


0.9.10   1999.07.04

  - preparation fo transition to input data in XML. Rewritten files
    gamalib/bodmer/zapis_*.*, mereni.h and prehled.il2/zakladni_parametry.h


0.9.9   1999.06.29

  - [Jan Pytel] a change in script `build' for the case when program
    cstocs is not installed and function Read_Sparse_Abw

    25c25
    < # include <gamalib/matvec.h>
    ---
    > # include <gamalib/bodmer/matvec.h>
    38,39c38,39
    < void Read_Sparse_Abw(istream& inp, GenMat<Float, Exc>& A,
    <                      GenVec<Float, Exc>& b, GenVec<Float, Exc>& w)
    ---
    > void Read_Sparse_Abw(istream& inp, MatVec::Mat_<Float, Exc>& A,
    >              MatVec::Vec_<Float, Exc>& b, MatVec::Vec_<Float, Exc>& w)


0.9.8   1999.06.22

  - in review of general parameters during search for maximal
    studentized residual added test for omitting observations with
    covariance < 1e-4 (after getu03)

  - in InfoSit::redakce_bodu() added forgotten test 
           if (tst_redbod_)  return;

  - class GSO moved to MatVec (class GSO is meant mainly for testing
    purposes - after all, it was during debuging of GSO when I found
    two silly bugs mentiond earlier :-)

  - a change in order in review: general information, fixed points,
    coordinates, orientation shifts, adjusted observations.


0.9.7   1999.06.21 

  - added zero version of algoritm GDO (gamalib/ls/matgso.h will
    be moved to MatVec when debugged)

  - conditional compile in version.cpp for gso vversion (implicitly is
    used algorithm SVD)


0.9.6   1999.06.18

  - gamalib/median: changes


0.9.5	1999.06.16

  - gamalib/median/pribl_b.cpp : bug in computation of multiple
    orientation shifts


0.9.4   1999.06.15

  - gama/gama.cpp / main(): output of residual, if asked for, is
    always donem ie. even for singular networks (residuals might be
    use later, for example combined adjustement etc.)

  - added a dummy file olsgso.h for adjustment based on algorithm GSO
    (so file bodmer/ols.h won't be changed later)

  - added function InfoSit::min_n() const ... number of unknowns
    entering regularization condition


0.9.3   1999.06.13

  - added print of m0 into general parameters
  - added template function PevneBody (prehled.il2/pevne_body.h)
  - a change in rovopr_u.cpp
  - file ls/ols.h renamed to ls/olssvd.h and template class GenOLS
    renamed to OLSsvd (=> a change in infosit/infosit.cpp). In file
    bodmer/ols added directives for conditional compile as a preparation
    for Gram-Schmid orthogonalization and other numerical methods.


0.9.2   1999.06.11

  - new version pribl_b.h and pribl_b.cpp (JV)
  - added control sums from md5sum for *.h *.cpp *.gkf
  - in script gama_linux/build added optional compile parameters
  - added missing end lines in some files aftter warning from
    parameter --pedantic (a heritage from NT ;-)
  - parameter --pedantic added explicitly into script build
  - program compiled with new version of MatVec 0.7.2
  - updated script gama_linux/build to recode all files with accents
    into 1250 a plain ascii. Originals of these files are now stored
    in gama/prehled.il2 (together with gama.cpp)
  - a change in InfoSit::defekt() to process possible exceptio
    MatVec::BadRegularization and return network defect
  - added pure virtual method bool BaseOLS::lindep(Index) for testing
    lineraly dependent columns ub project equations.
  - Methos lindep() defined in class OLS
  - changed return type of function ZakladniParametry
    (prehled.il2/zakladni_parametry.h) to bool:

      true   network is OK
      false  singular system with bad system of constrained points

    added review of linearly dependent columns (index, point, type)

  - ... I had to go through all of this just to find out a stupid error
    in rovopr_s.cpp (more orientation sets on a single point):

         $ diff rovopr_s.err rovopr_s.cpp 
         50c50
         <    indx_[ indx_[0]+1 ] = sbod.index_z();
         ---
         >    indx_[ indx_[0]+1 ] = sbod.index_z(osnova());

   - to be sure I removed implicit values of parameters in all
     functions for processing orientation shifts in class Bod (point):
     index_z(int), z(int), vloz_z(int), zrus_z(int), test_z(int)


0.9.1

  - transition to Linux as the main development platform (until now
    original sources were maintain on NT)


0.9.0  

   - added GNU licence

   - program GaMa (formerly version 0.6.4) was included as a part of
     library GaMaLib and no longer has its own version number.  Files
     verze.cpp and verze.h (in English: version), that used to contain
     version number of gama were removed.

==========================================================================

0.8.0  *********

   Changes made on transition to version 0.8
   ------------------------------------------

   Added library GaMaLib_Median for copmuting appsoximate coordinates

   New format of input data (poin a observation lists), new input
   format for adjustment of plain netwok.

   - class cti_txt replaced by template class InputTextStream, it
   relays on a sole method get(char&) for reading input.  In future it
   should enable reading data through sockets and the like.

   - from file seznam.h removed class CtiSeznam, renamed to
   CtiSeznamBM. File cti_sez.cpp renamed to ctisezbm.h, and inside it
   added template class CtiSeznamBM

  - in class InfoSit method nacti_soubor_BM renamed to
  nacti_vstupni_davku()

  - added file seznam.cpp (with functions pridej_seznam_mereni() and
  pridej_seznam_bodu() )

  - in computation of bearings added test on identical points ==>
  return 0;

  - in namespace GaMaLib defined class GaMaLibException (with single
  atribute text of type string) as a parent class of all exceptions
  used in GaMaLib library (existing exceptions modified)

  - deleted file bodmer/vyjimka.h

  - added second constructor of class bm_chyba, that enables to enter
  error description, line number a the content of the input line

==========================================================================

0.7.2

   - various minor changes on the way to standard C++ coding (removed
   most of conditional compile directives)
   - in class InfoSit removed helper class SeznamNeznamych_ formerly
   used during cinditional compile for VC++ and GNU C
   - in class Bod (point) removed helper class "list of orientation
   shifts", used in conditional compile with VC++ 5.0


0.7.1

  - transition to usege of functions std; (#include <iostream.h> to
   <iostream> etc.)
  - removed class GaMa_ofstream (from now we use only std::ofstream)
  - hopefully the last discrepancy with language standard is located
   in files cti_txt.h and cti_txt.cpp, in which remains class
   istrstream. Because class <stringstream> is not yet generally
   implemented I am leaving as it is.


0.7.0      *********   MatVec 0.7  ********

   Matrix and vector classes were totaly rewritten in matvec 0.7 (it's
   just a coincidence that versions equals for GaMaLib and MatVec). In
   all sources are gradually removed directives for conditional
   compile NonStdCpp (egcs enables usage of namespaces). Removed macro
   Std_

============================================================================

0.6.0      *********   MatVec   *********

  - new version of matvec updated for bc 5.4
  - in declaration of friend functions sort and trans added explicit

0.5.1
   - for VC++ defined class GaMa_ofstream (in infosit.h), that opens
   input text file for exclusive use by the applications. For other
   compilers GaMa_ofstream is just a substitute name for ofstream (typedef)

0.5.0      *********   BodMer   *********

   on transition to VC++ 5.0 /GNU C++ (egcs 2.90) the following
   header files have been changed:
   - float.h: added macro Std_, that replaces standard declaration
              std::xxx; updated (hopefuly) in all files
   - bod.h: for VC++ defined list of orientation shifts, that doen't
            use std::vector
   - bod.cpp: z_.size() replaced by call to poc_orpos()
            : a change in test_z() / need to split return and throw
   - cisbod.h: for VC++ added operator<<(ostream&, const CisBod&);

0.4.6
   - classe BaseOLS and OLS rewritten as templates (working version)
   - calss OLS renamed to GenOLS (analogically as GenMat and GenVec)

   all elements of type Float; for matrices given by lines).
      GenVec::GenVec(int, Float ...);
      GenMat::GenMat(int, int, Float ...);

   Note: given elements must be of type Float (no conversions) !!!

         virtual Delka* PtrDelka() { return 0; }
         virtual Uhel*  PtrUhel()  { return 0; }
   in child classes they are redefined to return pointer this
   (similarly 3 functions for constant objects).
   GNU C 2.7.2 has problems with RTTI, ie. dynamic_cast doesn't work
   properly

0.3.25

   - in class LTS set a weight of selected observations to R (ie. one
   observation gets heigher weight thea all remainnigntogether)
   - corrected wrong condition in Trimmed_Ab to the form:
        for (int p, i=1; i<=k; i++)
            {
               if (init)
                  {

   with the same meaning as in SVD.

   - the same in OLS

   `switching of' storage of solved combinations
   - LTS: change of the type of loop variabel from  `int' to `unsigned'
   in cases when compared with return value of type `unsigned'
   (just to get rid off warning messages)
   - after label TryNextPerm: added ';' ("label must be followed by
   a statement")

0.3.13
   - LTS: added output of solved combinations  
            PrintSolvedCombinations(ostream&, bool);
   - stored combinations are sorted by the number of their accesses

0.3.12
   - in class LTS added storing of solved combinations

0.3.11
   - in class LTS added attribute Sampling_is_solved_ (protects against
   repeted splves of known combination); the value is set by
   Reset_k(), Sampling() a Next()
   - minimal value LTS::K in function Reset_k() set to
   C+1 (number of unknowns + 1)
   - added third optional parameter for constructor for direct set 
   set of value K (negative value means "all observations")

0.3.10
   - in class LTS removed test function citac_permutaci()
   and test on similarity with previous combination (will be replaced 
   by test on solved permutations)

   and name GaMaLib_verze changed to GaMaLib_version, type changed
   from const std::string to const char*

   - similarly statistics function

   - computation of orientation shift moved from directory median into
   directory bodmer (changed namespace Median to GaMaLib)

   - added files gamarand.* with random number generator
   and class Comb for generations k-combinations of integers <1, N>

0.2.3
   - added test Kolmogorov-Smirnov (Stat_Anal)

0.2.2
   - added template function sort for class Vec (TMatVec 3.0.3)
   - functions sort(Vec) used in computation of median

0.2.1
   - changes in  MatVec.h (3.0.2) for GNU C (g++ 2.7.2)

0.2.0
   - transition to new version of MatVec

0.1.15
   - in class cti_txt rewritten  operator>>(std::string&)

   - class CtiSeznam ("ReadList") suplied with reading of configuration
       stanovisko / pb  # pevny bod       ..... fixed poind
       stanovisko / ub  # urcovany              adjusted
       stanovisko / ob  # operny                constrained
       stanovisko / nb  # neni bodem site       not used  

   - in output of points added point types 

   - in class InfoSit removed all methods for processing indput data

   - added/prepared methods:
      void InfoSit::nacti_soubor_BM(const string& soubor);
      void InfoSit::nacti_soubor_parametru(const string& soubor);
      void InfoSit::zapis_soubor_parametru(const string& soubor);

0.1.14
   - removed bug in calculation of approximate value of orientation shift
     Added test for the case when average is computed from a positive 
     and a negative value.

0.1.13

   - added function InfoSit::aktualizace() and enumeration type
   InfoSit::Redakce; calling of aktualizace() replaced by asignment
   tst_redbod_ = false (similarly tst_redmer_, tst_rov_opr_ and
   tst_vyrovnani_); previous control of the solution state was wrong

0.1.12
   - added removal of object attributes in class InfoSit in methods
   zrus_vsechny_body() and zrus_vsechna_mereni() [ remove all points
   and remove all observations ]

0.1.11
   - in class InfoSit added function  zrus_vsechna_mereni(),
   observations must be removed explicitly when needed 
   (not done by destructor !!!). Added function  zrus_vsechny_body().
   Both functions sets the appropriate solution state.

0.1.10
   - explicit usage of namespace names in parameters of function
   or_pos (for computing orientation shifts)

0.1.9
   - in class Mereni (observation) added private data member aktivni_
   (is active) and functions bool aktivni() const, void
   aktivni_mereni() aand void pasivni_mereni() to be used for
   "logically" deleting of observations (observations stays in the
   list but is not used in forming project equations)

   - bool test_bodu() renamed to bool redakce_mereni().  Apart from
   point testing (does it belong to network configuration) tests if an
   observation is active or passive. Renamed files test_bd, test_bs a
   test_bu na redmer_dm redmer_s a redmer_u.

0.1.8
   - added functions for inclusion of observation/point lists
   void pridej_seznam_bodu  (SezBod& cil, const SezBod& zdroj);
   void pridej_seznam_mereni(SezMer& cil, const SezMer& zdroj);

0.1.7
   - added function bool InfoSit::prazdny_seznam() [empty list]

   - function CtiSeznam::cti [read list] changed to accept empty lists
   of points and observations (empty or containing only white spaces)

0.1.6
   - new namespace Statisticka_analyza (GaMaLib/statan)

   - in class BaseOLS added pure virtual function defect() and
   defined in derived class OLS

   - added attributes and some methods for statistical analysis

0.1.5
   - in class InfoSit added helper functions for defining maximal
   output width for unknow indexes and point numbers
   
0.1.4
   - in class InfoSoubor replaced by private members path, IS,
   SB a KS of the class InfoSit, added destructor ~InfoSit()

0.1.3

   - in class InfoSit three public members: SB (point list),
   SM (observation list), Info (object of type InfoSoubor [InfoFile] )

   - added external string const Zakladni::GaMaLib_verze ... [version]

   - added structure Informace_o_siti::InfoSoubor for storing
   of file names and other network configurations data

0.1.2

   - removed another bug in computation of otientation shifts
   (orientation set with only two directions, one direction positive,
   the other negative)

   - added function members to class bod (point):

	   void nastav_pevny_bod();
	   void nastav_urcovany_bod();
	   void nastav_operny_bod();
	   void zrus_bod_site();
	   bool bod_site() const;
	   bool pevny_bod() const;
	   bool urcovany_bod() const;
	   bool operny_bod() const;

     function priznaky() removed


   - removed header file <bodmer/priznaky.h>

   - in class Mereni (observation ) removed "priznaky (tags)" InfoMer {
   vyloucit, pouzit} (these make no sense) and function priznaky()

   - bud in constructor of class Mereni (must not have implicit values
   for parametres observation / standard deviation).

   - added exceptions Bod_Mereni::bm_strch and bm_delka()

   - in functions mer() and str() removed test if(var_ <0) throw bm_udaj()

   - method vloz_mer(Double, Double) changed to be virtual,
   redefined in Delka [distance] (added test on negative distance)

0.1.1

   - corrected computation of orientation shifts (adding shifts into
   point list - on a certain configurations some shifts wouldn't get
   solved)

   - in class Mereni (observation) is method var() used instead of
   str(), because we work with variances and not with standard
   deviations.

   - similarly renamed function Format::var_p() from Format::str_p()

   - in class Mereni removed methods test_mer() and zrus_mer(),
   ie. "logically removed observations" are not supproted

   - corrected computation of coefficients for angles in project
   equations
