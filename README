GNU package Gama is a C++ free software for geodesy released under GNU
General Public Licence. Project Gama was started in 1998, in 2001 was
dubbed a GNU packaqe and today contains the following main components:

    [gamalib] C++ class library for handling geodetic observations
    (measurements) and points (coordinates), computation of
    approximate coordinates (needed for linearization) and adjustment
    of local geodetic networks in 3d.  C API to essential gamalib C++
    classes and functions is also available. Numerical solution of
    adjustment is based on orthogonal decomposition of the design
    matrix (ie without "normal equations"); currently supported
    algorithms are SVD and GSO (an algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt
    orthogonalisation). Adjustment on the ellipsoid is a long term
    goal.

    [program gama-local] C++ program for adjustment of horizontal
    geodetic network based on gamalib (also available as a public
    service accessible by email); format of input data is defined in
    XML. Data structures used in adjustment enable usage of general
    variance-covariance matrices of observations and are designed to
    enable implementation of sparse matrices in future versions.

    [matvec] C++ matrix/vector template classes used in adjustment
    computations in gamalib.

    [rocinante] is a GUI for GNU Gama based on Qt graphical library
    that is available for GNU/Linux under GNU GPL. Rocinante binaries 
    are also available for win32 platform; see 
                    http://roci.sourceforge.net/
    for more information.
